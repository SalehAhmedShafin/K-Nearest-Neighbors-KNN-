# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
KNN is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the label of a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving the tasks you've mentioned:

Load and Plot Training Data:

Read data from "train.txt".
Plot training points with different colored markers based on the assigned class label.
Implement KNN Algorithm:

Implement the KNN algorithm with user-defined K.
Classify the test points from "test.txt".
Plot the test points with different colored markers based on the predicted class label.
Write Predictions to "prediction.txt":

For each test data point, calculate distances and store the top K distances along with their class labels.
Write the predictions to "prediction.txt" as described.
